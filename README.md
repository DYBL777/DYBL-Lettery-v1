# DYBL - Decentralised Yield Bearing Legacy

**The Eternal Seed** — A Self-Sustaining Compounding Primitive

---

## One Sentence

A percentage of every payment is retained forever. The pot floor only rises.

---

## The Problem

Traditional lotteries reset to zero after every jackpot. Start over. Wait months.

Subscription payments drain away. No compounding. No shared upside.

PoolTogether nearly died when yields dropped. No buffer. No floor.

---

## The Solution

**The Eternal Seed.**

10% of every payment retained forever. Never paid out. Compounds via Aave.

Jackpot won? Seed stays. Pot rebuilds from higher floor.

No winner? Rolls over. Seed grows.

User breaks streak? 50% of their yield feeds the pot.

**Under normal conditions, the pot floor can only rise.**

| **Weekly draw** | Chainlink VRF (provably fair) |
| **5 prize tiers** | Match 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 to win |
| **Jackpot rolls over** | No winner? It grows |
| **Yield-bearing** | All deposits earn Aave yield |
| **Legacy Mode** | Set an heir, pass on your yield |
| **Mulligan** | One free missed week per year |

**Lettery is the proof of concept. The Overflow is the product.**
