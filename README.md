# DYBL - Decentralised Yield Bearing Legacy

## "The Eternal Seed" — A Prize Pot That Can Only Grow

---

### The Problem

Every lottery resets to zero after a jackpot. Prize pools drain completely. Start over.

### The Solution

**The Eternal Seed** — a set percentage of every payment is retained forever. 

The pot can only grow. Mathematically impossible to drain. A new way to generate yield.

## How It Works

| Source | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 10% Eternal Seed | Never paid out, accumulates forever |
| Ticket Sales | 65% of every ticket adds to pot |
| Jackpot Rollovers | No winner = stays in pot |
| Aave Yield | Seed compounds via DeFi |
| Forfeit Yield | Broken streaks → 50% to pot |

**There is NO scenario where the pot shrinks long-term.**
