# The Eternal Seed: How This Got Built

**A Builder's Journey**

## The First Question Wasn't To AI

Most people start with: "AI, build me a lottery."

I started with: "How can I build the biggest, fairest, most transparent, user-friendly game in the world?"

That question wasn't to Grok. Wasn't to Claude. It was to myself.

That's the difference. That's everything.

---

## AI Didn't Think For Me. I Thought. AI Built.

The first question to AI came quickly after. Once the direction was clear.

"How much yield does $1M earn in Aave in one week?"

That's a BUILD question. Not a THINK question.

I already knew WHAT. AI helped with HOW.

---

## Mistakes Are Essential

Most people don't start because mistakes terrify them.

So they never find out if it works.

Here's the truth: mistakes are the lifeblood of great things. Every wrong turn teaches. Every bad question leads to a better one. Every failure narrows the path to success.

The raw files show 600 hours of my mistakes. Every wrong turn. Every bad question. Every time I went in circles.

And it still worked.

No CS degree. No funding. No team. Humble background. Poor in money (not in the things that mattered). No formal education.

Built a DeFi primitive anyway.

If you're waiting until you're ready, you'll wait forever. Start. Fail. Learn. Repeat.

---

## Day 16

A major opportunity came and went at day 16. My fault. Didn't know how Git worked. Sent broken links. Door closed.

30 years of acceptance training and learning from my own countless mistakes meant I didn't spiral. I just built it myself.

That "failure" made me a builder, not an idea guy.

---

## How Questions Work

I've trained my mind to work a certain way. Still learning after 30 years.

Ask a "how" question. A real one. To yourself. Then let it sit.

Don't force. Don't grind. Flow. Allow.

The answer might come while feeding a seagull. Or at 3am. Or in the shower. Doesn't matter where. It comes.

This sounds soft. It isn't. It's a discipline. Hard to learn. Not for everyone.

But it's teachable. And it works.

---

## Step By Step

I didn't see the whole vision first and then build it.

I solved one problem at a time. The next question wouldn't come until the previous problem was fixed.

First: Do the numbers even work? Hours of playing with Aave rates, user spend, ticket prices. Making sure this wasn't fantasy.

The numbers worked.

Then: "How can I get around 6/49 regulatory issues?"

Couldn't just copy existing formats. Needed something different.

Within an hour or two, the answer came: Lettery. A meme alphabet. A different game entirely.

---

## How Lettery Found Its Alphabet

A mini-process inside the bigger process. This is exactly how it works:

Started with 26 characters. A-Z. Simple alphabet.

Problem: Odds too short for treasury to work.

New question: "How do I make odds better for treasury AND better for users?"

Tried 33 characters. Nice number. Added some extras.

Still too short.

Then: 42 characters. A-Z plus 0-9 plus specials.

Perfect. Better odds than 6/49. More fun to play. Treasury works.

That took a few hours. Failed twice. Adjusted twice. Then it clicked.

Then: "What do I call it?"

"It's a lottery with letters" came into my head. Two seconds later: LETTERY.

So obvious. That's how it works when the thinking is clear.

Only AFTER Lettery was solved did the next big question arrive.

---

## The 24-Hour Question

Then Pavlov - the behavioural toggle. Then Legacy mode. Each one a problem solved before the next question arrived.

Then the big one.

"How can I make the jackpot bigger?"

This one wouldn't leave. 24 hours, circling. Not forcing. Just... holding it.

The number one reason people play the lottery is jackpot size. I knew that. But how do you make it bigger without more players?

First came playing with the numbers. Aave rates. User averages. Trying to find more yield.

Then it popped:

"What if I retain 5% of the prize pot forever and never pay it out?"

Then: "Why not 10%?"

Then: "What if it just keeps rolling? Forever?"

The Eternal Seed.

It compounds. Alone. Doesn't even need Aave yield - that's just bonus. The seed grows by itself because it never leaves.

The floor can only rise.

---

## Then AI

Only after the thinking was done did AI become the partner.

A year learning AI properly. Not prompts. Conversation. Collaboration.

Grok built the core. Two weeks. The engine, the logic, the Solidity.

Then Claude. Patrick Collins recommended Claude for smart contract work. I'd followed him for years - trusted his advice. Good recommendation. Claude came in for refinement, edge cases, documentation, these papers.

Sometimes Gemini for cross-checking.

I broke Claude's weekly limit in 3 days. Paid £90 to continue. Didn't think twice.

But the AI didn't have the questions. I did. The AI helped me build the answers.

---

## The Work

600 hours. 7-8 weeks. Somewhere between 15 and 20 books worth of raw AI dialogue.

Not prompts. Conversations. Arguments. Wrong turns. Dead ends.

95% raw. Unpolished. Real. Mistakes everywhere.

Every decision documented. Every wrong turn. Every breakthrough. Every bug found and fixed.

The receipts exist.

---

## This Is Live

This paper is being written in real-time. The process you're reading about is the process that's creating what you're reading.

That's not an accident. That's how it works.

Still asking new questions every day. Still refining. The papers grow while being written.

This isn't a case study of something finished. It's a live process. Documented as it happens.

---

## How To NOT Prompt

The 600 hours of dialogue isn't a prompt library. It's the opposite.

It's how to NOT prompt. How to converse. How to argue. How to catch AI when it's wrong. How to lead the thinking while AI does the building.

Most AI education teaches you to prompt better. This teaches you to think better - then let AI follow.

---

## The Honest Truth

The raw files aren't examples of perfect prompting. They're the opposite.

You'll see where I could have done it faster. Where I asked badly. Where I got emotional. Where I went in circles.

That's the point.

It's not how an expert uses AI. It's how a real human thinks WITH AI. Messy. Emotional. Inefficient sometimes. Tired.

But it worked.

Everyone is different. My process won't be your process. But seeing a real human struggle, fail, adjust, and succeed - that's more useful than watching an expert glide through.

When condensed into a learning tool, the wrong turns become the lesson. The inefficiencies show what to avoid. The breakthroughs show what to chase.

---

## What Emerged

From one question to myself, a system:

**The Eternal Seed**
A percentage of every payment retained forever. The pot floor can only rise.

**Lettery**
The flagship demo. Meme alphabet. 42 characters. A lottery where the jackpot has a rising floor.

**The Overflow**
What happens when Lettery succeeds. Expansion into new pots. One lottery becomes infrastructure.

**The Guardians**
Trillion-dollar decisions need stewardship. A governance model for expansion.

**The Resilience Framework**
8 failure scenarios. What breaks, what we'd do, what we honestly don't know yet.

**Founder Succession**
A taper from founder share to zero over decades. The founder eventually returns to the Seed.

6 papers. Working code. 1,500+ lines. Chainlink VRF. Aave V3. BUSL protected. Patent pending.

From someone who spent 6 years studying blockchain and never wrote a line of code.

---

## The Process Compounds

Two weeks after DYBL core was done, another idea arrived. Different primitive. Same process. 90 minutes.

The first build took 8 weeks. The second took an hour and a half.

That's the point. The process compounds. First one hard. Second one fast.

---

## The Bugs

They happened. Of course they happened.

Solvency issues. Edge cases. Things that would have broken in production.

They were found. They were fixed. Every one documented.

A separate paper could come - the Security Journey. How the bugs were found, why they existed, how they were fixed. No time yet.

For now: the bugs existed, they're fixed, and the process is documented.

---

## The Vision

Not an app. Not a flip. Not an exit.

Infrastructure.

50-100 years. The Eternal Seed outlasts founders, outlasts companies, outlasts any single partner.

Hopefully Chainlink for oracles. Cyfrin for security. Aave for yield. Truflation for economic governance.

Infrastructure partners. Each essential. Each benefits when the system grows.

---

---

## Why Share This

This isn't a pitch deck.

This is how it's happening. The real version. Questions asked to myself, then AI helped build. Mistakes made, lessons learned.

30 years of training a mind to work this way. 6 years studying blockchain. 8 weeks building. Still going.

Maybe the primitive matters. Maybe the thinking behind it matters more.
